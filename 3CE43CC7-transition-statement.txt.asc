Sunday 26th November 2017

For a variety of reasons I have set up a new GPG Key and will be transitioning
away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid, however new signatures will be created
from this key. This message is signed by both keys to validate the transition.


The old key was:

    pub  4096R/3CE43CC7 2015-09-17
         Fingerprint=9B34 AEB9 DEF9 E4C1 5CEC  E6E7 35D2 D098 3CE4 3CC7

The new key is:

    pub  4096R/4B34C887 2017-11-26
         Fingerprint=D1AE C706 CB9D 2B49 AEC0  4EF7 2DF3 678C 4B34 C887

Note that the signing of this message may have been done by a SUBKEY of
that key, which may make the key id listed in the signature not match
the fingerprint listed here. You can verify it by checking the key listed
here for the subkey used in signing this message.

To fetch the new key from a public key server, you can use the following:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 4B34C887

If you already know my old key, you can verify that the new key has been
signed by the old one, so the trail of signatures can still be followed:

    gpg --check-sigs 4B34C887

If you don't know my old key, or you want to be extra careful, you can
check the fingerprint against the one above:

    gpg --fingerprint 4B34C887

You can verify the signatures on this message by downloading the plain
text file as linked and running:

    gpg --verify [name of downloaded file]

If you are satisfied that you have the right key, that the UIDs match what
you expect, and you are certain of my identity, I would appreciate it if
you would sign my new key:

    gpg --sign-key 4B34C887

And finally, if you have signed it, to upload the signatures:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 4B34C887

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Regards,
Danielle Tomlinson
